/*
Write a program to control a bread machine. 
Allow the user to input the type of bread as W for White and S for Sweet.
Ask the user if the loaf size is double and if the baking is manual. 
The following table details the time chart for the machine for each bread type. 
Display a statement for each step. If the loaf size is double, 
increase the baking time by 50%. If baking is manual, stop after the loaf-shaping 
cycle and instruct the user to remove the dough for manual baking. Use functions to 
display instructions to the user and to compute the baking time.
