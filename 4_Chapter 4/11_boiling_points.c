/*
The table below shows the normal boiling points of several substances. 
Write a program that prompts the user for the observed boiling point 
of a substance in Â°C and identifies the substance if the observed 
boiling point is within 5% of the expected boiling point. If the 
data input is more than 5% higher or lower than any of the boiling 
points in the table, the program should output the message Substance unknown.
